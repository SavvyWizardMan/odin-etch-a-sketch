# The Odin Project - Etch a Sketch Solution 

This is a solution to the [Etch-a-Sketch challenge on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). The Odin Project is a free open-source coding curriculum that provides a comprehensive study path for aspiring developers.

## My process

### Built with

- Figma (wireframe)
- HTML
- CSS
  - Flex Containers 
  - Custom Properties 
- JavaScript 
  - DOM Manipulation
    - Element creation to add all of the squares in the grid based on a user defined size 
    - Element removal to remove squares and replace them when grid size is updated
    - Event Listeners to update pen color and grid size when input is changed

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- Using '!+tab' will autofill the HTML boilerplate ü§Ø
- Can put a min and max range on an input element and that there are a lot of different input types 
- Explored different types of event listeners (mouseover, mouseup/down) üñ±Ô∏è
- DOM element creation can be removed and replaced 



Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('üéâ')
}
```
